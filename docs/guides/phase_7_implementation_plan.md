# EchoForge Phase 7 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 7 of EchoForge, focusing on the Meta-Forging Orchestrator and emergence capabilities. The plan is structured into parallel tracks to optimize development efficiency, with clear convergence points for system integration.

## Current System Status

### Core Architecture

- The component map shows a well-structured system with clear interfaces between components
- SoulMeshProtocol provides distributed consciousness capabilities
- ConflictResolution mechanisms exist but need metrics integration
- Regression test infrastructure is in place but needs execution

### Meta-Forging Orchestrator

- OrchestratorCore structure is defined with key components:
  - MetaAgentRegistry
  - DirectiveRouter
  - EmergencePredictor
  - StateSnapshotEncoder
- Component interfaces are defined but implementation is incomplete

### Conflict Resolution Metrics

- ConflictResolutionMetrics class exists with metric registration
- Event listener setup is incomplete (placeholder in code)
- SoulMeshMetricsIntegration tests show expected integration patterns

### Testing Infrastructure

- Regression test script configured for test suites and emergence simulations
- Emergence simulation log template exists but needs population

## Implementation Priorities

### Track A â€” Regression & Metrics Infrastructure

#### Task 1: Run Regression Tests

- Execute `scripts/run_regression_tests.js`
- Generate baseline report
- Identify any failing tests for immediate resolution

#### Task 2: Implement ConflictResolutionMetrics Event Listeners

- Complete the `setupEventListeners()` method in `ConflictResolutionMetrics.ts`
- Bind to SoulMeshProtocol events
- Implement handlers for conflict detection, resolution, and rollback

#### Task 3: Expand Metrics Test Coverage

- Add unit tests for all event types
- Verify metric recording and pattern detection
- Test metric history integrity

### Track B â€” Orchestrator Bootstrap

#### Task 4: Complete Orchestrator Component Logic

- Implement DirectiveRouter logic
- Complete MetaAgentRegistry functionality
- Develop EmergencePredictor pattern detection
- Implement StateSnapshotEncoder serialization

#### Task 5: Add Unit + Integration Tests

- Create tests for each orchestrator component
- Verify component interactions
- Test emergence pattern detection

### Convergence Phase

#### Task 6: Implement Emergence Response Mechanisms

- Add response strategies for each emergence pattern:
  - ConflictCascade
  - VectorClockDivergence
  - RollbackChain
- Integrate with EmergencePredictor

#### Task 7: Finalize Launch Checklist

- Run comprehensive emergence simulations
- Update emergence simulation log
- Complete all checklist items

## Execution Order

Following the user's recommended execution order:

1. Start with ConflictResolutionMetrics integration
2. Proceed with parallel tracks:
   - Track A: Metrics and regression testing
   - Track B: Orchestrator component implementation
3. Converge for emergence response implementation
4. Finalize with launch checklist completion

| ðŸŸ¢ Low    | Launch Checklist Completion               | `docs/phase_7_launch_checklist.md`               |

## Next Steps

The immediate next step is to implement the ConflictResolutionMetrics event listeners, as this will provide the foundation for system awareness needed for emergence detection and response.
