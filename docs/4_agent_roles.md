## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Hierarchical Collaboration
- **Orchestrator** manages overall workflow
- **Specialist agents** handle specific tasks
- **Clear chain of command** and responsibility

### Peer-to-Peer Collaboration
- **Agents communicate directly** with each other
- **Shared decision-making** processes
- **Collaborative problem-solving** approaches

### Pipeline Collaboration
- **Sequential processing** through agent chain
- **Output of one agent** becomes input for next
- **Efficient data flow** and processing

### Broadcast Collaboration
- **Single agent** broadcasts to multiple receivers
- **Parallel processing** of similar tasks
- **Aggregation** of results from multiple agents

## Agent Configuration

### Basic Agent Configuration

```typescript
interface AgentConfig {
  id: string;
  type: AgentType;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  capabilities: Capability[];
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  dependencies: string[];
  resources: ResourceRequirements;
}
```

### Role-Specific Configuration

Each agent type has specific configuration options:

```typescript
interface OrchestratorConfig extends AgentConfig {
  maxConcurrentTasks: number;
  defaultTimeout: number;
  retryPolicy: RetryPolicy;
  escalationRules: EscalationRule[];
}

interface AnalystConfig extends AgentConfig {
  dataSource: DataSourceConfig;
  analysisModels: string[];
  reportTemplates: string[];
  visualizationOptions: VisualizationConfig;
}
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Loose Coupling**: Agents should be independent and replaceable
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality should be grouped together
4. **Scalability**: Agents should be designed for horizontal scaling
5. **Resilience**: Agents should handle failures gracefully

### Communication Guidelines

1. **Asynchronous Communication**: Use event-driven messaging
2. **Standard Protocols**: Implement consistent message formats
3. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. **Monitoring**: Include comprehensive logging and metrics
5. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Performance Optimization

1. **Resource Management**: Efficient use of computational resources
2. **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across multiple agent instances
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics and bottlenecks
5. **Optimization**: Continuously improve agent performance
