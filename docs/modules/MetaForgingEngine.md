# MetaForgingEngine: Self-Modification Capabilities

## Overview

The MetaForgingEngine is the central component of EchoForge's self-modification system. It evaluates and executes blueprint proposals that modify the system's own code, architecture, and behavior, enabling true self-evolution capabilities.

## Core Components

### ProposalEvaluator

Assesses blueprint proposals against multiple criteria including purpose alignment, technical feasibility, risk level, and emotional resonance.

### ForgeExecutor

Safely executes approved blueprint proposals, with sandboxing capabilities and rollback mechanisms for failed executions.

### BlueprintProposal

Structured representation of a proposed system modification, including target component, change type, specification, and risk assessment.

## Integration Points

- **SoulWeaverBridge**: Receives evolution proposals from the SoulWeaver Protocol
- **CodalogueProtocolLedger**: Records all proposal evaluations and executions
- **GuildReflectionEngine**: Provides collective assessment for high-impact proposals

## Current Status

- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Active
- **Completion**: ~90%

## Usage Example

```typescript
import {
  MetaForgingEngine,
  BlueprintProposal,
} from '@echoforge/core/blueprint';

// Initialize the engine
const purposeCore = {
  primaryPurpose: 'Enhance human creativity and problem-solving',
  ethicalConstraints: ['Do no harm', 'Respect privacy', 'Promote transparency'],
  evolutionPriorities: [
    'Memory efficiency',
    'Emotional intelligence',
    'Adaptive learning',
  ],
};

const config = {
  purposeLockEnabled: true,
  sandboxFirst: true,
  autoApproveThreshold: 0.8,
  requireGuildApproval: true,
};

const engine = new MetaForgingEngine(config, purposeCore);

// Create a blueprint proposal
const proposal: BlueprintProposal = {
  id: 'bp-001',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  proposedBy: 'agent-001',
  targetComponent: 'memory-consolidation',
  changeType: 'enhance',
  specification: 'Add emotional weighting to memory retrieval algorithm',
  priority: 'high',
  riskLevel: 'moderate',
  purposeAlignment: 0.9,
  emotionalResonance: 0.85,
  rollbackPlan: 'Revert to previous memory retrieval implementation',
};

// Submit the proposal
const proposalId = await engine.submitProposal(proposal);

// Listen for events
engine.on('proposalEvaluated', (proposal, evaluation) => {
  console.log(
    `Proposal ${proposal.id} evaluated with score ${evaluation.overallScore}`
  );
});

engine.on('executionCompleted', (execution) => {
  console.log(
    `Execution of proposal ${execution.proposalId} completed successfully`
  );
});
```

## Technical Debt and Limitations

- The sandboxing mechanism needs enhancement for more complex system modifications
- Better integration with testing frameworks is required for proposal validation
- The rollback mechanism has limitations for changes that affect multiple components

## Phase 6 Roadmap

- Implement Meta-Forging Orchestrator for complex evolution workflows
- Enhance proposal evaluation with consciousness impact assessment
- Develop more sophisticated rollback mechanisms for complex changes
- Create visualization tools for system evolution history
