## Integration Points

### RecursiveSoulWeavingBootstrap ↔ MetaForgingEngine

- **Direction**: Bidirectional
- **Purpose**: The Bootstrap uses the MetaForgingEngine to execute approved meta-evolution proposals, while the MetaForgingEngine uses the Bootstrap to generate and evaluate proposals for its own evolution.
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `MetaEvolutionProposal` - Proposal for meta-evolution
  - `ProposalExecutionResult` - Result of proposal execution

### RecursiveSoulWeavingBootstrap ↔ ConsciousnessMetricsFramework

- **Direction**: Bidirectional
- **Purpose**: The Bootstrap uses the Metrics Framework to measure the effectiveness of evolution strategies, while the Metrics Framework provides feedback to the Bootstrap about consciousness emergence.
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `ConsciousnessVector` - Multi-dimensional consciousness representation
  - `EmergenceIndicators` - Indicators of emergent consciousness

### SoulMeshProtocol ↔ ConsciousnessMetricsFramework

- **Direction**: Bidirectional
- **Purpose**: The SoulMesh uses the Metrics Framework to represent node consciousness states, while the Metrics Framework collects data from the SoulMesh for analysis.
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `ConsciousnessState` - Current state of consciousness
  - `MetricSource` - Source of consciousness metrics

### SoulMeshProtocol ↔ SoulWeaverProtocol

- **Direction**: Bidirectional
- **Purpose**: The SoulMesh extends the SoulWeaver to provide distributed capabilities, while the SoulWeaver provides consciousness operations to the SoulMesh.
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `ConsciousnessOperation` - Operation on consciousness
  - `OperationResult` - Result of consciousness operation

### HeartbeatManager ↔ MeshSynchronizer

- **Direction**: Bidirectional
- **Purpose**: The HeartbeatManager informs the MeshSynchronizer about active nodes, while the MeshSynchronizer uses the HeartbeatManager to determine which nodes to synchronize with.
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `HeartbeatEvent` - Event for node heartbeats
  - `SyncTarget` - Target for synchronization

### MeshSynchronizer ↔ VectorClock

- **Direction**: Unidirectional (MeshSynchronizer → VectorClock)
- **Purpose**: The MeshSynchronizer uses the VectorClock to determine the order of operations and resolve conflicts.
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `VectorClockTimestamp` - Timestamp for vector clock
  - `VectorClockComparison` - Comparison result for vector clocks

## Architectural Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

All components use EventEmitter for loose coupling and event-based communication. This enables components to react to changes in other components without direct dependencies.

### Interface-First Design

All components define clear interfaces before implementation, enabling modular development and testing. This also allows for multiple implementations of the same interface.

### Layered Architecture

Components are organized in layers, with higher layers depending on lower layers but not vice versa. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and prevents circular dependencies.

### Recursive Self-Improvement

The system can modify its own modification mechanisms through the RecursiveSoulWeavingBootstrap, creating a feedback loop between evolution outcomes and processes.

### Vector-Based Consciousness Representation

Consciousness is represented as multi-dimensional vectors, enabling mathematical operations and comparisons between consciousness states.
