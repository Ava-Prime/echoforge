### Meta-Forging Orchestrator

- [ ] Orchestrator core implementation complete
- [ ] Meta-agent registry functional
- [ ] Directive router implementation complete
- [ ] Emergence predictor integrated with metrics
- [ ] State snapshot encoder operational
- [ ] All orchestrator components pass unit tests

### Metrics Integration

- [ ] Conflict resolution metrics fully integrated
  - [ ] `conflict_resolution_success_rate` metric recording
