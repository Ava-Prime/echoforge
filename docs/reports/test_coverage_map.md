# Test Coverage Map

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current test coverage across the EchoForge codebase. It identifies areas with existing test coverage, highlights gaps, and provides recommendations for improving test coverage to meet the project's quality standards.

## Current Test Coverage

### Packages with Tests

#### Recomposer Package

The `recomposer` package has the most comprehensive test coverage in the codebase:

| File                  | Purpose                       | Test File                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `BlueprintComposer`   | Handles blueprint composition | `BlueprintComposer.test.ts`   |
| `CapabilityExtractor` | Extracts capabilities         | `CapabilityExtractor.test.ts` |
| `BlueprintDiff`       | Compares blueprints           | `BlueprintDiff.test.ts`       |
| `CompositionOptions`  | Configuration for composition | `CompositionOptions.test.ts`  |
| `ExtractionOptions`   | Configuration for extraction  | `ExtractionOptions.test.ts`   |
| `DiffResult`          | Results from diff operations  | `DiffResult.test.ts`          |
| Integration tests     | End-to-end functionality      | `integration.test.ts`         |

#### Codessa Package

The `codessa` package has limited test coverage:

| File              | Purpose        | Test File                 |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| `ValidatorEngine` | Validates code | `ValidatorEngine.test.ts` |

### Packages Without Tests

The following critical packages have no identified test files:

1. **EchoCore Package** - The core framework has no dedicated test files despite being a critical component.
2. **ForgeKit Package** - The foundational toolkit lacks test coverage.
3. **Mirror Package** - The synchronization utilities have no tests.
4. **SoulMesh Protocol** - No tests for the distributed consciousness protocol.
5. **ConsciousnessMetricsFramework** - No tests for the metrics collection and analysis.
6. **RecursiveSoulWeavingBootstrap** - No tests for the core orchestration engine.

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Critical Components Without Tests

1. **Phase 6 Components**:
   - `RecursiveSoulWeavingBootstrap`
   - `SoulMeshProtocol`
   - `ConsciousnessMetricsFramework`

2. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - Memory management systems
   - Event emission and handling
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Configuration management

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Component interactions
   - Cross-module communication
   - API boundaries

### Test Types Missing

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Missing for most core components
   - No validation of individual function behavior

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Limited testing of component interactions
   - No validation of system-wide behavior

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - No benchmarking or performance validation
   - No stress testing for distributed operations

4. **Regression Tests**:
   - No automated tests to prevent regressions

## Recommendations

### Priority Areas for Test Development

1. **Core Components** (Highest Priority):
   - Create unit tests for `ConsciousnessMetricsFramework`
   - Develop tests for `SoulMeshProtocol` focusing on node communication
   - Implement tests for `RecursiveSoulWeavingBootstrap` orchestration

2. **Integration Testing** (High Priority):
   - Test interactions between major components
   - Validate event propagation across the system
   - Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

3. **Infrastructure Components** (Medium Priority):
   - Test configuration management
   - Validate logging and monitoring systems
   - Test file system operations

### Test Implementation Strategy

1. **Test Framework**:
   - Standardize on Jest for consistency with existing tests
   - Implement shared test utilities for common operations

2. **Coverage Goals**:
   - Aim for 80% code coverage for critical components
   - Focus on testing business logic and error handling paths
   - Prioritize tests for public APIs and interfaces

3. **Test Organization**:
   - Maintain tests alongside source code in `__tests__` directories
   - Follow naming convention of `[FileName].test.ts`
   - Group tests by component and functionality

## Conclusion

The current test coverage in the EchoForge codebase is limited primarily to the `recomposer` package, with significant gaps in critical components. Implementing the recommended testing strategy will improve code quality, reduce regressions, and facilitate future development efforts.

Priority should be given to developing tests for the Phase 6 components to ensure they meet the quality standards required for the upcoming Phase 7 integration with the Meta-Forging Orchestrator.
