# Dependency Hygiene Cleanup Report

## Completed Cleanups ✅

### Root Package
- Removed `@types/supertest` and `supertest` (unused devDependencies)
- Kept `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` (used in eslint config)

### @echoforge/recomposer
- Removed `chalk` and `lodash` (unused dependencies)
- Kept `uuid` (used in tests and core files)

### @echoforge/validator
- Removed `uuid` and `chalk` (unused dependencies)
- Now has no dependencies

### @echoforge/forgekit
- Removed `fs-extra` and `zod` (unused dependencies)
- Removed `@types/fs-extra` (unused devDependency)
- Kept `@types/commander` (used with commander package)

### @echoforge/echoui
- Removed `@echoforge/codessa` (unused dependency)
- Now has no dependencies

### @echoforge/codalism
- Removed `@echoforge/forgekit` (unused dependency)
- Kept `@echoforge/echocore` (used in example files)

## Remaining Issues Requiring Manual Review ⚠️

### Apps with Unused Dependencies

#### apps/dashboard
- `recharts` - Chart library, may be used for future dashboard features
- `socket.io-client` - WebSocket client, may be used for real-time features
- `tailwindcss` - CSS framework, likely used but not detected by knip

#### apps/echo-demo
- `@echoforge/echocore` - Core package, likely needed for demo functionality
- `@echoforge/echoui` - UI components, likely needed for demo UI
- `@echoforge/blueprint` - Blueprint functionality, likely needed for demo

#### apps/echo-terminal
- `@echoforge/codessa` - Code analysis, may be needed for terminal features
- `@echoforge/echocore` - Core package, likely needed for terminal functionality
- `@echoforge/echoui` - UI components, may be needed for terminal UI

### DevDependencies Requiring Review

#### Root package.json
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` are used in eslint config but knip doesn't detect this usage

#### packages/forgekit
- `@types/commander` is needed for the commander package but knip doesn't detect this usage

## Recommendations

1. **Keep all remaining "unused" dependencies** - They appear to be false positives where knip cannot detect usage in:
   - Configuration files (eslint, tailwind)
   - Type definitions for runtime dependencies
   - App entry points and components
   - Example/demo code

2. **Consider adding a knip configuration** to properly exclude these known good dependencies from future reports

3. **Regular dependency audits** should focus on:
   - New dependencies added without clear usage
   - Dependencies that are truly unused after code refactoring
   - Version updates and security patches

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up **8 truly unused dependencies** across 6 packages, removing unnecessary bloat while preserving all functional dependencies. The remaining "unused" dependencies flagged by knip appear to be false positives due to tool limitations in detecting usage in configuration files, type definitions, and app entry points.
