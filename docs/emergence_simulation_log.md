## Pattern Analysis

### Conflict Cascade

**Description:**
A pattern where a single conflict triggers a cascade of additional conflicts across multiple components or nodes.

**Detection Metrics:**

- Conflict rate exceeding 10 conflicts per second within 500ms
- Multiple components experiencing conflicts within 500ms of initial conflict
- Vector clock divergence exceeding threshold of 50

**System Response:**

- Temporarily increase conflict resolution priority
- Implement progressive backoff for non-critical components
- Trigger system-wide synchronization if cascade continues for >2 seconds

**Effectiveness:**
[Assessment of response effectiveness]

---

### Vector Clock Divergence

**Description:**
A pattern where vector clocks across nodes become significantly out of sync, leading to false conflict detection or missed conflicts.

**Detection Metrics:**

- Maximum vector clock difference exceeding threshold of 50
- Conflict resolution failures exceeding 30% of attempts
- Rollback rate exceeding 3 rollbacks per minute

**System Response:**

- Trigger targeted synchronization between divergent nodes
- Temporarily reduce write operations on affected components
- Log detailed vector clock state for post-analysis

**Effectiveness:**
[Assessment of response effectiveness]

---

### Rollback Chain

**Description:**
A pattern where state updates repeatedly fail validation, causing a chain of rollbacks that can lead to system instability.

**Detection Metrics:**

- Rollback events exceeding 3 rollbacks within 2 seconds
- Same component experiencing multiple rollbacks
- Validation failures exceeding 70% of attempts

**System Response:**

- Create emergency snapshot before continuing rollback chain
- Isolate affected components from further modifications
- Implement gradual state reconstruction from stable components

**Effectiveness:**
[Assessment of response effectiveness]
