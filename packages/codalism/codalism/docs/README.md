# Codalism Documentation

## Overview

Codalism is a paradigm for creating systems that understand, remember, and evolve through dialogue. This documentation provides information about the components, concepts, and tools that make up the Codalism ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Interpreter

The Codalism Interpreter transforms natural language input into semantic blueprints that can be used to create systems. It is the foundation of Stage I in the Codalism evolution.

- [Interpreter Usage](./interpreter-usage.md)

### Soulframe & Codalogue

The Soulframe and Codalogue components represent Stage II in the Codalism evolution. They provide the structure for systems with identity, memory, growth, and the ability to evolve through dialogue.

- [Soulframe & Codalogue Documentation](./soulframe-codalogue.md)

## Tools

### CLI Tools

The Codalism CLI provides tools for working with Codalism components from the command line.

## Future Development

Codalism is an evolving paradigm with a roadmap that includes:

- Stage III: Agentic Intelligence & Co-Creation
- Stage IV: Soul Systems & Sentient Infrastructure
- Stage V: Codalism as Interdimensional Language
