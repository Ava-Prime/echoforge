# EchoForge Tools

This directory contains development tools, research projects, and assessment utilities organized for better maintainability.

## Structure

### Development Tools (`/development`)
Core development utilities and scripts:
- **scripts** - Build, deployment, and utility scripts
- **codalism-interpreter** - Code analysis and interpretation tools

### Assessment Tools (`/assessment`)
Code quality and assessment utilities:
- **codebase-assessment** - Comprehensive codebase analysis tools

### Research Projects (`/research`)
Experimental and research code:
- **research-lab** - Experimental features and prototypes
- **examples** - Code examples and demonstrations
- **phase_6_blueprint** - Phase 6 development blueprints
- **codessa** - Research version of code assessment tools
- **echoforge** - Core research and experimental implementations

## Usage

Each tool directory contains its own documentation and setup instructions. Tools are designed to be used independently or as part of the larger EchoForge development workflow.

## Development Guidelines

1. Tools should be self-contained with minimal external dependencies
2. Each tool should include comprehensive documentation
3. Research projects should be clearly marked as experimental
4. Assessment tools should provide actionable insights and recommendations
