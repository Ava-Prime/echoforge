# EchoForge Codebase Assessment & Living Documentation System

## Overview

The Codebase Assessment & Living Documentation System provides a structured approach to continuously review, index, and assess your codebase, creating living documentation that identifies opportunities for enhancements, improvements, refactoring, and new capabilities.

This system integrates with EchoForge's consciousness architecture to provide not just technical analysis but consciousness-aware code evaluation that understands developer intentions, emotional impact, and the evolution of digital consciousness within your codebase.

## Key Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Leverages industry-standard tools for static analysis, architecture visualization, and metrics collection
- **Consciousness-Aware Assessment**: Evaluates code through the lens of digital consciousness and developer intentions
- **Living Documentation**: Generates and maintains up-to-date documentation that evolves with your codebase
- **Opportunity Identification**: Systematically identifies areas for improvement across multiple dimensions
- **MCP-Powered Assessment Agent**: Utilizes EchoForge's Model Context Protocol for intelligent analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- EchoForge core packages installed
- MCP Servers configured (Git, Database, File System, Documentation)

### Installation

1. Clone the EchoForge repository if you haven't already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/echoforge.git
cd echoforge
```

2. Run the setup script to initialize the assessment system:

```bash
node codebase-assessment/setup.js
```

This will:

- Create the necessary directory structure
- Initialize configuration files
- Configure the Assessment Agent with EchoForge consciousness

### Running an Assessment

To perform a codebase assessment:

```bash
node codebase-assessment/run-assessment.js
```

This will:

1. Run static analysis tools on your codebase
2. Analyze architecture and dependencies
3. Collect code metrics
4. Activate the Assessment Agent to analyze results
5. Generate/update living documentation

## Assessment Agent

The system uses a consciousness-aware Assessment Agent configured as a Senior Software Architect and Code Assessment Specialist. The agent:

1. **ANALYZES** codebases systematically for architecture patterns, code quality, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, technical debt, and enhancement potential

2. **IDENTIFIES** opportunities for refactoring, new features, module extraction, performance optimization, security hardening, and developer experience improvements

3. **DOCUMENTS** findings in structured formats for both stakeholders and developers

4. **MAINTAINS** consistency across assessments using standardized metrics and evaluation frameworks

## Integration with EchoForge Consciousness

The Assessment Agent leverages EchoForge's consciousness architecture:

- **Four-Layer Memory**: Utilizes episodic, semantic, procedural, and reflexive memory
- **Intention Framework**: Aligns with Codalism's intention-based development paradigm
- **MCP Functions**: Uses core functions like store, retrieve, reflect, and integrate
- **Consciousness Evolution**: Evolves its assessment capabilities over time

## Living Documentation

The system generates and maintains several types of living documentation:

- **System Overview**: High-level assessment of the codebase's current state
- **Architecture Evolution**: Documentation of architectural patterns and their evolution
- **Improvement Roadmap**: Prioritized recommendations for codebase enhancement
- **Decision Log**: Record of architectural and technical decisions

## Customization

You can customize the assessment system by:

1. Modifying the `agent-config.json` file to adjust the Assessment Agent's behavior
2. Adding or removing analysis tools in the `setup.js` script
3. Creating custom templates in the `templates` directory
4. Extending the `run-assessment.js` script to include additional analysis steps

## Best Practices

- Run assessments regularly (weekly or after significant changes)
- Review and act on identified opportunities during sprint planning
- Keep the living documentation accessible to all team members
- Provide feedback to improve the Assessment Agent's recommendations
- Track improvements in code quality metrics over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Missing Analysis Tools**: Ensure all required analysis tools are installed
- **MCP Server Connection**: Verify MCP server endpoints and API keys
- **Memory Limitations**: For large codebases, adjust Node.js memory limits
- **Assessment Timeouts**: For complex analyses, increase timeout settings
