# TODO - Phase II: EchoCore Runtime Initialization

## Overview
Phase II focuses on building the core runtime infrastructure for EchoCore, establishing the foundation for code execution, compilation, and agent-based interactions.

## Key Areas of Development

### 1. Compilation Targets
- [ ] Define supported compilation targets (native, WASM, JIT)
- [ ] Implement target-specific code generation
- [ ] Optimize compilation pipeline for different deployment scenarios
- [ ] Add cross-compilation support for multiple architectures

### 2. Virtual Machine Design
- [ ] Design EchoCore VM architecture and instruction set
- [ ] Implement bytecode generation and interpretation
- [ ] Build memory management and garbage collection
- [ ] Create debugging and profiling capabilities
- [ ] Establish sandboxing and security boundaries

### 3. Agent Execution Model
- [ ] Define agent lifecycle management (spawn, execute, terminate)
- [ ] Implement inter-agent communication protocols
- [ ] Build agent state persistence and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Create resource allocation and scheduling system
- [ ] Establish agent security and permission models

### 4. Runtime Infrastructure
- [ ] Build core runtime libraries and APIs
- [ ] Implement standard library functions
- [ ] Create runtime configuration and initialization system
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Establish error handling and logging framework

## Dependencies
- Completion of Phase I (language foundation and basic tooling)
- Integration with existing EchoCore language features
- Coordination with frontend/parser components

## Success Criteria
- Functional VM capable of executing EchoCore programs
- Support for multiple compilation targets
- Robust agent execution environment
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking suite
- Documentation for runtime architecture and APIs

*This roadmap will be refined as Phase I completes and requirements become clearer.*
